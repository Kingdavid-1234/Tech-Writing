Project Document: Binary Search Trees - Analysis and Design

 Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to implement and analyze the operations of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. A BST is a fundamental data structure used in computer science for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements. The objectives of this lab include implementing BST operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching, and analyzing the results of these operations.

 Methodology:
Program Description
The program consists of a Java implementation of a Binary Search Tree. The `Node` class represents a node in the BST, containing an integer key, and references to its left and right children. The `Binary Search Tree` class manages the BST operations, including insertion, deletion, searching, and in order traversal.

Inputs:
The program takes a series of integers as input keys, inserted into the BST. In the provided example, keys {50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80} are inserted.

Outputs:
The program outputs the in-order traversal of the BST, demonstrating the sequence of keys after each insertion and deletion operation. For instance:

In order traversal of the given tree: 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
Delete 20
In order traversal of the modified tree: 30 40 50 60 70 80
Delete 30
In order traversal of the modified tree: 40 50 60 70 80
```

Methods and Variables:
- insert (int key): Inserts a new node with the given key into the BST.
- delete (int key): Deletes a node with the given key from the BST.
- search (int key): Searches for a node with the given key in the BST.
- in order (): Initiates an in-order traversal of the BST, printing the keys in ascending order.
- minValue (Node root): Finds the minimum value in the BST starting from the given node.

 Results:
The results demonstrate the correct implementation of BST operations. After inserting the keys {50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80}, the program displays the in-order traversal of the BST as "20 30 40 50 60 70 80". After deleting nodes with keys 20 and 30, the modified BST's in-order traversal is displayed as "30 40 50 60 70 80".

Significance:
The significance of these results lies in showcasing the proper functioning of BST operations, ensuring that nodes are inserted, deleted, and searched correctly while maintaining the BST properties.

Conclusions:
From this project, we learned the essential operations involved in managing a Binary Search Tree. The successful implementation of insertion, deletion, and search operations demonstrates a sound understanding of the underlying algorithms. Furthermore, we observed the importance of maintaining the BST properties during these operations to ensure efficient data management.

 Recommendations:
Efficiency Optimization: Consider optimizing the BST operations for large datasets, possibly by implementing balancing techniques like AVL trees.
Error Handling: Enhance the program to handle edge cases, such as invalid inputs or attempts to delete non-existing nodes, to improve robustness.
Visualization: Implement visual representations of the BST to aid in understanding the tree's structure and operations visually.

In conclusion, this project provides a foundational understanding of Binary Search Trees and their operations. By incorporating the recommendations, the program's functionality and usability can be further enhanced for practical applications.
